        </ul>
        <p>Lets discuss these points in detail:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Plan Ahead</h3>
          </li>
          <p>While this tip works for just about any journey you're taking, it is doubly helpful for a country like
            Pakistan, where a lack of advanced reservations and bookings can result in unexpected delays. Plan your
            itinerary as well as your transport and accommodation well in advance. If you don't want to plan the trip on
            your own, there are several tour groups operating in the country that will take you to your desired
            destinations with either pre-planned or custom-made itineraries.</p>
          <p>Having a local guide can help you during security checks, in communicating with the locals, as well as in
            attaining a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) if you want to visit some of the restricted areas in the country.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>Learn The Local Language</h3>
          </li>
          <p>While most people in the major cities will have some fluency in English, enough to be able to communicate
            with you, learning a few phrases of the country’s national language, Urdu, is recommended. The effort you
            make
            to learn their language is greatly appreciated by the local populace. It will surely help you in
            understanding
            them better and communicating with them in the upper parts of the country in the smaller towns.</p>
          <li>
            <h3>Be Aware Of The local Culture </h3>
          </li>
          <p> the country is a mix of several ethnicities, with Punjabis, Balochis, Pashtuns, Sindhis, as well as
            ‘Urdu-speaking’ communities living together but following their private cultural practices and traditions.
            Respect the cultural practices of the locals that you meet, do not enter a mosque with your shoes on, and
            dress as modestly as you can, avoiding shorts, skirts, and low necklines.</p>
          <li>
            <h3>Mungle with the Locals</h3>
          </li>
          <p>Pakistanis are hospitable people who love to have guests over for meals and will truly enjoy showing you
            around town. They will go to great lengths to ensure that you are comfortable and might also insist on
            paying for your meals or shopping trips. If you are uncomfortable with the kind of attention and kindness
            being showered upon you as a foreigner, be diplomatic in declining their invites and offers. Revering guests
            is part of their culture, and they really mean no harm by it in most cases.</p>
          <li>
            <h3>Always Carry some money in Cash</h3>
          </li>
          <p>Pakistan’s currency is the Rupee, and with a cash-based economy, all tourists to the country should
            consider carrying some cash with them at all times. Plastic money is acceptable at malls, hyper stores, and
            ATMs, but everyday transport needs are generally met via cash transactions or apps. You can search for some
            prepaid wallet apps in Pakistan that can help you avoid carrying cash or minimum cash. You should also
            consider getting your currency exchanged before entering the country or find reliable money exchange
            companies in larger cities. Avoid the currency exchange at the airports, because they will always have
            higher exchange rates in comparison to local branches.</p>
          <li>
            <h3> Bargain hard for the best deals</h3>
          </li>
          <p>Another thing to know before travelling to Pakistan is that haggling for prices is common in almost all the
            major markets of Pakistan, and it is a haven for bargain shoppers. If you know how to haggle like a pro,
            you’re in good hands. Otherwise, you’ll need to work hard to avoid paying more than is due for your
            purchase. Ideally, take a local along with you if you can. Shopkeepers will automatically raise prices for
            foreigners, and letting a local buy your goods is one way to get fair prices for them.</p>
          <li>
            <h3>Carry Photocopies of Important Documents </h3>
          </li>
          <p>Make sure you have all the necessary documents before you travel and carry several photocopies of each
            document with you throughout your journey. You will be required to submit copies of your documents at
            several check posts around the country. Rest assured that the security staff is generally courteous and
            welcoming of foreigners, but these checks are for your own safety and not having copies at hand will make it
            more time consuming than it needs to be.</p>
          <li>
            <h3>Stay vigilant for your own safety</h3>
          </li>
          <p>While Pakistan is now a lot safer for tourists, it is always best to plan proactively for the best times to
            visit places or to avoid certain areas. Heed warnings from the locals and the police. Carry your cash in two
            to three different pockets and watch out for pickpockets. Avoid using your phone in a secluded area where
            you might attract the attention of mobile snatchers.</p>
          <li>
            <h3>Stay connected to the Folks back Home</h3>
          </li>
          <p>Several local telecom operators offer their sim cards that will work well throughout the country for local
            calls as well as internet data packages that will allow you to ring up your loved ones back home. Do your
            research while planning for a trip to Pakistan and buy a sim upon reaching the country. Get a local to do it
            for you if you can, as foreigners might be charged more for local sims. </p>
          <li>
            <h3>Watch out for Foods and Beverages</h3>
          </li>
          <p>Pakistani food is generally spicy, so be prepared to test your taste buds to the limit if you are going for
            local foods. Foreign cuisine varieties are available in major cities if you want milder options. Always
            drink bottled water that is sealed tight before you open it. Tap water is not drinkable, and refilling water
            bottles with tap water is a common practice in many roadside restaurants. Do not drink the water unless it
            comes from a sealed bottle. Alcohol consumption is frowned upon, and it is preferable to stay sober during
            your travel to Pakistan. Fruits, dry fruits, biryani, nihari, lassi, and Kashmiri chai are just some of the
            must-try items here.</p>
